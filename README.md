# handwriting-recognition-neural-network
Neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

First time implementing a neural network.

Trained and tested using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits.

******  Programming done using C++  ******

Compilation:
  I have included a makefile to see an example of my compilation.
